    <h1>Lesson 18: The Moral Order of Work</h1>
    <p>Work is an essential part of human life, not just for survival but as a meaningful responsibility that gives purpose and fulfillment. Since the beginning of time, humans have been called to work, setting them apart from other creatures. While work can be a source of a serious problem or may be a source of happiness.</p>

    <p>Beyond earning a living, work allows us to participate in God's ongoing care for the world. The Church teaches that each person has a role to fulfill: the husband is called to provide needs and protect his home; the wife is called to nurture and create a good home environment; children learn their lessons and help; retirees contribute their time, knowledge, and skills to the Church and the community; and even those who suffer physical ailments are called to offer their suffering in union with Christ’s suffering on the Cross. In short, our dignity comes from being created in God's image and finding true fulfillment in embracing our unique calling.</p>

    <h2>Let Everyone Work</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we command you, brothers and sisters, to keep away from every believer who is idle and disruptive and does not live according to the teaching you received from us. For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example. We were not idle when we were with you, nor did we eat anyone’s food without paying for it. On the contrary, we worked night and day, laboring and toiling so that we would not be a burden to any of you. We did this, not because we do not have the right to such help, but in order to offer ourselves as a model for you to imitate. For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: “The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat.”</p>

        <p>We hear that some among you are idle and disruptive. They are not busy; they are busybodies. Such people we command and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to settle down and earn the food they eat. And as for you, brothers and sisters, never tire of doing what is good.</p>

        <p>Take special note of anyone who does not obey our instruction in this letter. Do not associate with them, in order that they may feel ashamed. Yet do not regard them as an enemy, but warn them as you would a fellow believer.</p>

        <p>May the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way. The Lord be with all of you.</p>

        <p>I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand, which is the distinguishing mark in all my letters. This is how I write.</p>

        <p>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.</p>

        <cite>2 Thessalonians 3:6-18</cite>

    <h2>The Moral Order of Work</h2>

    <h3>A. The Dignity of Work</h3>
    <p>Work has both an ideal and a subjective meaning. Objectively, it possesses the activities, resources, and technologies used to deliver goods and exercise control over the earth. Subjectively, it is an essential human activity linked to personal vocation and dignity. While the objective aspect of work changes with technology and society, the subjective element remains constant because it is connected to human dignity. Therefore, the personal value of work should take priority over its economic aspects. Work is more important than capital, which can take different forms, such as material, financial, human, and social capital. While work and capital must function together, workers should share in company ownership, management, and profits to create harmony in production.</p>

    <h3>B. The Right to Work</h3>
    <p>Work is a rudimentary right that promotes self-worth, personal growth, and fulfillment, while unemployment is dehumanizing. Beyond employment itself, several labour issues require attention. Women must have equal opportunities in the workforce, as their contributions enhance production. Child labour must be dealt with to ensure proper education and prospects. Migrant workers deserve dignity, as they often fill labour gaps and contribute to economic growth. Agricultural labour should be strengthened due to its vital role in society and the environment, requiring effective land reform programs. Eventually, work is essential for maintaining human dignity, supporting families, and allowing individuals to own property, making employment opportunities a key social responsibility.</p>

    <h3>Labor Problems and Justice</h3>
    <p>Labor problems need to be addressed, including ensuring women's fair share in the labor market, preventing child exploitation, treating migrant workers with dignity, and fostering agricultural labor. A just wage is the legitimate fruit of work, allowing workers to cultivate their material, social, cultural, and spiritual lives for the common good.</p>

    <h3>Types of Justice</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Commutative Justice:</strong> Based on equality in Give and Take, with the object of the right being profit.</li>
        <li><strong>General or Legal Justice:</strong> The community is responsible for passing laws favorable to the common good.</li>
        <li><strong>Distributive Justice:</strong> Regulates the measure of privileges, aids, burdens, and obligations of individual members as community members.</li>
        <li><strong>Social Justice:</strong> Focuses on basic human rights and the determination of a just wage, emphasizing the importance of social justice over mere economic exchange.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Other Rights Related to Work</h3>
    <p><strong>The Right to Strike:</strong> Strikes are permitted as a last resort but should not harm the public good, innocent parties, or involve threats of violence.</p>
    <p><strong>The Right to Protection and Social Security:</strong> Employees deserve job security, livelihood protection, and support during sickness, disability, or unemployment.</p>
