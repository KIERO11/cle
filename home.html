	<h1>How does faith guide you in finding your perfect match?</h1>
	
	<p>Finding a perfect match is often seen as a journey of love, trust, and divine guidance. From a theological perspective, faith plays a central role in this process, shaping
	our understanding of relationships, commitmment, and purpose. Here are ways in which faith can guide you:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Trusting in Divine Timing.</li>
		<li>Seeking Compability in Faith and Values.</li>
		<li>Love as a Reflection of Divine Love.</li>
		<li>Discernment Through Prayer and Community.</li>
		<li>Understanding Marriage as a Sacred Covenant.</li>
		</ul>
	<p> Thus, faith teaches that finding a perfect match is not about searching for an idealized person but about becoming the right person, someone who embodies love,
	patience, and faith. It helps individuals not only find a partner but also build a relationship that reflects the divine plan.</p>
	
	<h1>The Institution of Marriage</h1>
	
	<p>The institution of marriage, as we know it today in most of the known world, is the product of the evolution and convergence of three cultural traditions:
		<ul>
		<li> Jewish Tradition</li>
		<li>Roman Tradition</li>
		<li>Germanic Tradition</li>
		</ul>
	
	<h2>Ephisains 5:21-33</h2>
	
	<p>Let all kinds of sumbission to one another become obedience to Christ. So, wives to their husbands: as to the Lord.
		The husband is the head of his wife, as Christ is the head of the Church, his body, of whom he is also the Savior. And as the Church submits to Christ, so let a wife submit 
	in everything to her husband. As for you, husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the Church and gave himself up for her. He washed her and made her holy by baptism in the Word.
	As he wanted a radiant Church without stain or wrinkle or any blemish, but holy and blameless, he himself had to prepare and present her to himself. In the same way, husbands
	should love their wives as they love their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. And no one has ever hated his body; he feeds and takes care of it. That just what 
	Christ does for the Church, because we are the members of his body.
		Scripture says: Because of this a man shall leave his father and mother to be united with his wife, and the two shall become one felsh. This is a very great mystery, and I 
	refer to Christ and his Church. As fro you, let each one love his wife as himself, and let wife respect her husband.</p>
	
	<h1>Jewish Tradition</h1>
	
	<P>In Jewish Tradition, marriage is contained in the Gensis creation accounts and insists on the twofold meaning of marriage, procreation and union, though
	procreation eventually took priority.</p>
	<p>In addition, the well-being of children is highly valued. They play a crucial role in ensuring survival, growth, and resilience of the chosen people. As a result, having
	many children is seen as a profound blessing from the Lord. Marriage was primarily for bearing children to:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Preserve the husband's family</li>
		<li>Maintain the existence of the Jewish people</li>
		<li>Fullfill Israel's covenant with God</li>
		</ul>
		
	<h2>2 stages of Jewish Marriage</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>Kiddushin (Betrothal)</li>
		<li>Nissuin (Wedding proper</li>
		</ul>
		
		
	<h1>Kiddushin or Solemn Betrothal</h1>
	<p>Though Technically an engagement, was legally binding and breakable only by divorce and required sexual fidelity.
	
	<h1>Nissuin or Wedding Proper</h1>
	<p>A year later kiddushin, the nissuin involved a week-long family feast led by the groom's father, not religious figures. The ceremony ended when the bride's father
	 "gave her away" and with the groom leading his bride to his (or his parents') home, marking the finalization of marriage.</p>
	
	
	<h1>Roman Tradition</h1>
	
	<P>In Roman Tradition, requires (1) the capacity of the man and of the woman to marry; (2) their desire to marry; (3) the expression of this desire.</p>
	<p>Roman marriages evolved through three stages:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Confarreatio - An early religious ceremony involving a sacrifice to jupiter</li>
		<li>Coemptio - A symbolic "purchase" of the bride, transferring her from father's power to her husband's</li>
		<li>Matrimonium Liberium - By the 2nd and 3rd centuries B.C.E., this became the norm in treating women as equals, allowing them to keep their name, share their home equally, and even initiate divorce</li>
		</ul>
	
	<h3>Matrimonium Clandestinum</h3>
	<p>Later, Roman influence led to matrimonium clandestinum (Secret Marriage, where mutual consent alone created a valid marriage — no witnesses or ceremony needed. This cause problems, like spouses denying the marriage later, with no way to prove the truth.</p>
	
	<h3>Church ended  Matrimonium Clandestinum and the Council of Trent (1545-1563) Tametsi Decree (1563) </h3>
		<p> With this decree, a canonical form was required for a valid marraige, established:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Marriage must be witnessed by a priest and two others</li>
		<li>Public announcements (banns) on three Sundays before marriage</li>
		<li>Secret marriages declared invalid.</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>Germanic Tradition</h1>
	
	<P>The Germanic people found fault with the Roman way of marrying, which focused on the exchange of marital consent.</p>
	<p>They insisted on a series of acts:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Betrothal or Engagement - the mutual exchange of a promise to marry</li>
		<li>Desponsatio - the exchange of the wedding pledges, with the groom giving the bride a ring and arrhae and the wife giving the groom her dowry</li>
		<li>Wedding proper - the mutual exchange of marital consent</li>
		<li>Consummation - the first sexual intercourse of the couple after the wedding</li>
		</ul>
	
	<p>St. Augustine defended marriage by highlighting three key "goods of marriage" (bona matrimonii), or the goods of marriage. He classified thse good into two groups: (a) primary goods and (b) secondary goods.</p>
	
	<h2>Primary Goods (Bona Primaria):</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>Bonum prolis – The good of offspring: Having children fulfills God’s command to "Be fruitful and multiply," proving that marriage is good.</li>
		<li>Bonum fidei – The good of fidelity: Spouses give authority over their bodies to each other, symbolizing mutual trust, faithfulness, and devotion — reflecting faith in each other and in God.</li>
		<li>Bonum sacramenti – The good of indissolubility: Marriage is a sacrament, representing Christ’s eternal, unbreakable bond with the Church. Since this divine love is unending, human marriage must also be indissoluble.</li>
		</ul>
		
	<h2>Secondary Goods (Bona Secundaria):</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>Amicitia coniugalis – Marital friendship, fostering companionship and affection.</li>
		<li>Mutuum adiutorium – Mutual assistance, supporting each other in life’s burdens and duties.</li>
		<li>Remedium concupiscentiae – A remedy for concupiscence (sexual desire), channeling human sexuality into a moral, loving union.</li>
		</ul>
		
	<p>St.Augustine connects marriage to scripture, particularly Ephesians 5:22-33, where the husband-wife relationship mirrors Christ's headship over the Church. 
	Though the passage speaks of wives submitting to husbands, Augustine interprets this as a call for mutual submission — each spouse serving the other in love, modeled after Christ's self-giving for his Church.</p>
	
	
	<h1>Threats to Marriage</h1>
	
	<p>This passage discusses the threats to marriage, particularly infidelity and divorce, from a Catholic perspective. According to the Code of Canon Law, marriage is defined by unity and indissolubility, and both infidelity and divorce threaten these essential properties. Infidelity, seen as a betrayal of trust,
	is compared to broken glass that can never be fully repaired. The text also highlights how boundary violations, such as close friendships with the opposite sex, can be a slippery slope leading to marital issues.</p>
	
	<h2>Divorce</h2>
	<p>Divorce, while permitted in the Old Testament, is presented as something that Jesus rejected, emphasizing that marriage was intended to be permanent from the beginning. The passage explains that the Pharisees debated the reasons for divorce, with some allowing it for minor reasons while others only accepted adultery as a valid cause. However, Jesus' response reinstated the idea that marriage is indissoluble. 
	Despite this, there are exceptions through annulments, which declare a marriage invalid from the start due to specific reasons such as unlawful relationships or religious conversion.</p>
	
	
<img src="divorce.jpg">
	
	
	<p>The text also introduces the Pauline and Petrine Privileges, which provide cases where a Christian partner can be freed from marriage due to the other spouse’s abandonment or refusal to convert. The final section encourages readers to reflect on their own future wedding vows, considering the promises they would make and the values they would bring into their marriage. 
	This reinforces the theme of commitment and the importance of upholding the sanctity of marriage.</p>
